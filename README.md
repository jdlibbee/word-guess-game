In the hangman gam there are functions that after a win or loss it will reset the guessed word and then count up the wins and losses. It will continue to randomly choose a word from the words array, and add the guessed letters from what the user chooses on the keyboard. Once the user chooses the correct word, the image will change to the movie poster, and play a sound clip from the movie. Should the user lose, it will change the image to a game over sign, and play a wawa trombone sound.
